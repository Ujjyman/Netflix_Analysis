# Netflix Data Insights Using SQL
Business Problem:
Netflix wants to gather meaningful insights from their extensive catalog of shows and movies. However, with approximately 82,000 rows of combined data, the sheer volume poses a challenge. They require a robust and scalable data analytics solution that can efficiently process the dataset and uncover valuable trends related to content performance, viewer engagement, and genre distribution.

How I Plan On Solving the Problem:
To help Netflix extract actionable insights from this large dataset, I will be using SQL for querying, filtering, and analyzing the data. By leveraging SQLâ€™s powerful functions, I aim to uncover key metrics such as IMDb-based ratings, genre trends, decade-wise distributions, and age certification patterns. The analysis will be structured to identify the most and least popular content, genre frequency, and the impact of content ratings. The results will be summarized using Excel to support clear and concise reporting, enabling informed decision-making based on data-driven insights.

Questions I Wanted To Answer From the Dataset:

Which movies and shows on Netflix ranked in the top 10 and bottom 10 based on their IMDb scores?

How many movies and shows fall in each decade in Netflix's library?

How did age certifications impact the dataset?

Which genres are the most common?
